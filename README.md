# semantic-movie-search
Semantic Movie Search is a simple python app powered by Elasticsearch and txtai. 

It takes in a user input, gets the top 50 Elasticsearch results, then runs a txtai semantic similarity function on the top 500 Elasticsearch results, reranks them, and returns the new top 50 to compare.
